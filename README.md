# [err](https://sr.ht/~smlavine/err)

err is a small error-printing library for C programs. It was initially
written as part of [navipage](https://sr.ht/~smlavine/navipage). For
examples of its use, see that project.

err can be used in projects written in any major version of C or C++.

These functions print exclusively to stderr.

The BSDes provide similar functionality in their standard library with a
[file of the same name][freebsd-err.h]. This library does *not*
implement that interface, and might behave completely differently.

# Using err

- Copy err.c and err.h into your project.
- `#include "err.h"` in files where you want to use err functions.
- Assign a value to `program_invocation_name` before calling any err functions.
- Call functions from err as you see fit!

## Documentation

err uses Doxygen to generate documentation. To compile the documentation
into a readable form, run `doxygen`. The generated files will be put
into the `docs/` directory.

Documentation is compiled to HTML and manpage formats.
The HTML documentation will be made available in an online form soonâ„¢.

The source code comments can also be read directly.

See the [examples/][examples] directory for example programs.
